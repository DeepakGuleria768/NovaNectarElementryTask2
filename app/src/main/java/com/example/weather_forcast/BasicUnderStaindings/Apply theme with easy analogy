How to Apply This to ANY App: The "Design Audit"
When you start a new app or look at an existing design:

Find the Star: What's the main color used for your brand's logo, primary buttons, or the most important elements? That's Primary.
Find the Supports: What color is used for accenting things that are important but not the "star"? That's Secondary.
Find the Pops: Is there a third distinct accent color used sparingly for special details? That's Tertiary.
Find the Containers: What color are your cards, dialogs, bottom sheets, or toolbars? That's Surface.
Find the Canvas: What's the very deepest background color of the screen itself? That's Background.
Find the Warnings: What color is used for error messages or invalid states? That's Error.
Find the Text/Icons: For every piece of text or icon, identify the background it's on.
If it's on Primary, its color is On Primary. If on Surface, it's On Surface, and so on.
